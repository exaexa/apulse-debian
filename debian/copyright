License: LGPL-2.1+
  The upstream license clarifies pretty well that the sources of pulseaudio are
  LGPL (please see LGPL license grant below), but that some parts will be
  effectively GPL since they rely on GPL libraries, quoting the upstream
  LICENSE:
    .
    """All PulseAudio source files are licensed under the GNU Lesser General
    Public License. (see file LGPL for details)
    .
    However, the server side links to the GPL-only library 'libsamplerate'
    which practically downgrades the license of the server part to GPL (see
    file GPL for details), exercising section 3 of the LGPL.
    .
    Hence you should treat the client library ('libpulse') of PulseAudio as
    being LGPL licensed and the server part ('libpulsecore') as being GPL
    licensed. Since the PulseAudio daemon and the modules link to
    'libpulsecore' they are of course also GPL licensed.
    .
